# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to our Diabetes Prediction project! We aim to predict diabetes in female patients of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 or older, based on specific medical diagnostic measurements. Our project utilizes a dataset sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

- The dataset includes independent variables such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
- The target variable is 'Outcome,' with 1 indicating diabetes and 0 indicating no diabetes.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**: We ensure data quality by handling missing values, duplicates, and zero values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into data distribution and relationships with our EDA.
- **Feature Engineering**: Apply a quantile transformation to improve feature distribution.
- **Model Evaluation**: We assess multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, and RandomForestClassifier.
- **Performance Metrics**: Check out our performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- **Results Documentation**: Code and results are available in this repository for reference and analysis.
